# Juno Apps Bug Tracker

This is an **issue tracker** for Juno and Juno Connect. Juno is an app running Jupyter locally on your iOS device, and Juno Connect is the Jupyter _client_ for iOS. You can find more details here: **[juno.sh](https://juno.sh)**.

Please, report any requests or defects you encounter with Juno or Juno Connect by [opening an issue](https://github.com/rationalmatter/Juno-Issue-Tracker/issues/new/choose) in this repo. Don't forget to [search for existing issues](https://github.com/rationalmatter/Juno-Issue-Tracker/issues) first, in case someone else has reported your thing already — and if someone has, rather comment on existing issue, this will help us prioritise things.
