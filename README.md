This is an **issue tracker** for Juno, an app running Jupyter locally on your iOS device (currently only distributed via Testflight).

Please, report any requests or defects you encounter with Juno by [opening an issue](https://github.com/navoshta/Juno-Issue-Tracker/issues/new/choose) in this repo. Also, please report any modules or packages that you would like to be pre-installed. Don't forget to [search for existing issues](https://github.com/rationalmatter/Juno-Issue-Tracker/issues) first, in case someone else has reported your thing already. Please, _do not_ report issues with the Juno client here (i.e. the one available on the AppStore, the Jupyter client app).

Juno is currently in active development, so I expect quite a few things not to work — please, report anything you notice that doesn't feel right. There are a few things that will be implemented or fixed soon (no need to report those):

* Native file management (similar to Pages, Numbers, etc.)
* Associating notebook file type with Juno (e.g. opening notebooks from Files app)
* Syncing documents via iCloud
* Updating to Python 3.7
* Package management for pure Python modules

Juno currently ships with the following packages pre-installed:
* NumPy 1.16.1
* Matplotlib 3.0.3
